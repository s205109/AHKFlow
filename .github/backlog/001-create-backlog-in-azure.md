# 001 - Create backlog in Azure (epics + initial items)

## Metadata

- **Epic**: Backlog setup
- **Type**: Feature
- **Interfaces**: (N/A)

## Summary

Create the epics and initial backlog items in Azure so planning and tracking can happen in a single source of truth.

## User story

As a product owner, I want the backlog represented in Azure so that work can be planned, estimated, and tracked consistently.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Epics exist in Azure matching the product vision (Hotstrings, Hotkeys, Profiles, Script Generation & Download, Platform).
- [ ] Initial backlog items are created with titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria matching this repository backlog.
- [ ] Items have a clear ordering (rank/stack order).
- [ ] Work item types and fields (e.g., estimates) are agreed and applied.

## Out of scope

- Automated synchronization between Markdown and Azure.

## Notes / dependencies

- If you want automation later, consider generating work items via Azure DevOps REST API or GitHub issues.
