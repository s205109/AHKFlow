# 002 - Setup GitHub Flow and project branching

## Metadata

- **Epic**: Backlog setup
- **Type**: Feature
- **Interfaces**: (N/A)

## Summary

Setup GitHub project, branching strategy, and branch protection rules for the repository.

## User story

As a repository administrator, I want a GitHub Flow-based branching model and protection rules so that contributions are reviewed and CI runs before merging to `main`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] GitHub project or issue tracker is created with backlog items.
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured for `main` (required reviews, status checks).
- [ ] PR template and contributing guidance exists.

## Out of scope

- Implementing CI workflows themselves (see CI/CD backlog item).

## Notes / dependencies

- References initial backlog import (001).
